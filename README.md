### me
- [ ] [hour] Plumbing: filter
- [ ] [hour] Plumbing: search
- [ ] [hour] Port SVG support to Logosnatch (fixes all the 'logo not found but logo exists' issues)
  that entry; same thing for entries)
- [ ] [hour] Implement the 'Report error' button on the entry page
- [ ] [hour] color the tree so that it's easy to see the different levels (alternate colors for depth=1? is easiest, see
  then)
- [ ] [hour] Implement the alternative interactions for mobile (i.e. hover on an entry to highlight them doesn't work)
- [ ] [minutes] Highlight the path to the highlighted entry
- [ ] [minutes] Optimize Logosnatch's size picking algorithm
- [ ] [minutes] Make the edges nicer
- [ ] [minutes] Mobile support (move the filter sidebar to a bottom bar that pops out, wrap the navigation bar)
- [ ] [minute] Link Give feedback to feedback form for now

### next sprint (ideas)
- [ ] take a look at the TSC issues
- [ ] Sprite for favicons?
- [ ] Ditch cdn.forevue.org (more resilient)
- [ ] [hour] Privacy policy (not needed for now)
- [ ] Expand the map+filter to full screen once scrolling 
- [ ] Easy way to reset the filters (button?) 
- [ ] Have a "strict mode" for hydration where you run checks that take longer (like active_url) 

### Fun ideas
- RSS feed

#### postponed (needs rethinking)
- [ ] [hour] Add the "changelog" to the navigation bar that lists the new entries since the last visit
