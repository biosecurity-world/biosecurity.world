                </p></li>
            <li>
                <p>This license includes a right for the operator to make your content available to, and pass these
                    rights
                    along to, service providers with whom the operator has contractual relationships related to the

            other side of any legal claims you might have to reimburse the operator for as soon as possible. If the
            operator
            fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won’t have to reimburse the operator for costs that you
            could
            have defended against or lessened with prompt notice. You agree to allow the operator to take over
            investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims you would have to reimburse the operator for, and to
            cooperate with those efforts. The operator agrees not to enter any settlement that admits you were at fault
